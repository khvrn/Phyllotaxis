# Phyllotaxis
A visual animation of phyllotaxis based off the following scientific paper [Phyllotaxis](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch4.pdf). This paper introduces mathematical models for the arrangement of spiral pyllotactic patterns.

Phyllotaxis is *the regular arrangement of lateral organs on a plant,* or the arrangment of leaves or seeds on an axis or stem.
